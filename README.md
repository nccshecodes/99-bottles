# 99 bottles of OOP

It turns out that everything you need to know about Object-Oriented Design (OOD) can be learned from
the "99 Bottles of Beer" song.
Well, perhaps not everything, but quite certainly a great many things.
The song is simultaneously easy to understand and full of hidden complexity, which makes it the
perfect skeleton upon which to hang lessons in OOD.

## Before reading the book

You’ll learn more from this book if you spend 30 minutes working on the "99 Bottles of Beer" problem
before starting to read.

## Doing the exercise

The test suite and exercise are written in Ruby. If you’re unfamiliar with the language, ruby-lang.org
has installation instructions, a gentle tutorial (Ruby in Twenty Minutes), and further references.

To run the test suite, invoke Ruby with the path to the test file.

The test suite contains one failing test, and many skipped tests. Your goal is to write code that passes all
of the tests. Follow this protocol:
* run the tests and examine the failure
* write only enough code to pass the failing test
* unskip the next test (this simulates writing it yourself)
Repeat the above until no tests is skipped, and you’ve written code to pass each one.

Work on this task for 30 minutes. The vast majority of folks do not finish in 30 minutes, but it’s useful,
for later comparison purposes, to record how far you got. Even if you can’t force yourself to stop at that
point, take a break at 30 minutes and save your code.
